# bb-plugin-gitlab

GitLab issues and merge requests inside BB, with one-click agent dispatch.
Self-managed instances are first-class: every host `glab` is logged into is a
host this plugin can reach.

```sh
bb plugin install /path/to/bb-plugin-gitlab
```

## What it does

- **Sidebar panel** (GitLab tanuki, full width): Issues and Merge requests tabs
  across every tracked project, with a project filter (persisted in
  localStorage), state chips, an "Assigned to me" toggle, and a New issue form.
- **Issue detail**: markdown description, notes, comment box, state, assignee
  and label editing, plus "Send agent". Deep-linkable through the URL hash:
  `#/issues/<host>/<namespace/path>/<iid>`.
- **Merge-request detail**: source → target branch, mergeability, pipeline jobs,
  approvals, reviewers, conversation notes, inline discussion threads, and
  per-file diffs. Deep-linkable as `#/merge_requests/<host>/<namespace/path>/<iid>`.
- **Send agent / Review with agent**: spawns a BB worker thread on the issue (or
  a review thread on the merge request) in the matching BB project. The item
  then shows a ⚡ pill linking to the thread.
- **Homepage section**: recent open issues with the same Send agent buttons.
- **Mentions**: `#` completes GitLab issues, `!` completes merge requests (`@`
  does both); the selected item's title, state, and description are attached as
  agent context at send time.
- **`bb gitlab` CLI**: `projects`, `issues [project]`, `mrs [project]`, `sync` —
  also discoverable by agents through the plugin-commands skill, alongside the
  bundled `gitlab` skill that teaches `glab` conventions.

## Auth and any GitLab domain

Uses the GitLab CLI, so the plugin reaches whatever instances `glab` reaches —
`gitlab.com`, a self-managed instance on any domain, or several at once. Every
host that appears as `Logged in to <host> as <user>` in `glab auth status` is
usable; if no host is authenticated the plugin reports needs-configuration. No
tokens are stored by the plugin.

```sh
glab auth login --hostname gitlab.example.dev
bb plugin reload gitlab
```

A host's own glab config describes how it is reached, and the plugin reads that
config instead of guessing, so these all work:

| Hosting | glab config on that host | What the plugin does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Plain domain, any TLD | — | uses the hostname as-is |
| Served under a path, `https://example.com/gitlab/` | `subfolder: gitlab` | drops the subfolder from project paths |
| API on a non-default port | `api_host: example.com:8443` | maps the port-bearing remote back to the host |
| Git over SSH on another name | `ssh_host: ssh.example.com` | maps that remote to the same instance |
| Plain HTTP, private CA, mTLS, proxy | `api_protocol`, `ca_cert`, `client_cert`, `proxy` | nothing needed — glab applies them |
| Internationalized domain | — | normalized to punycode, matched case-insensitively |

Ports and schemes never appear in a project ref: `glab --hostname` takes a bare
hostname, and the ref keeps exactly the name glab knows. IPv6 literal hosts are
the one gap, because glab rejects them.

## Which projects are tracked

A project is addressed by its **host-qualified ref**:
`gitlab.example.dev/group/subgroup/app`. The host is the first segment; the rest
is the namespace path, which may have any number of segments.

- Every BB project whose git remote points at an authenticated GitLab host —
  including remotes that use that host's `ssh_host`, `api_host`, or subfolder
  form. That mapping is also how "Send agent" picks the BB project to spawn in.
  The remote comes from BB's own project record, so a checkout on an enrolled
  remote host resolves exactly like a local one. A remote on a GitLab host glab
  is not logged into is reported in `bb plugin logs gitlab`.
- Plus the `extraProjects` setting: a comma-separated list of refs, normalized
  for you — a scheme, mixed case, a port, a subfolder, or a trailing slash are
  all accepted, and a bare `group/app` uses `defaultHost`.
- `defaultProject`: where threads spawn for GitLab projects with no BB project.

```sh
bb plugin config gitlab set extraProjects "https://Code.Example.dev:8443/gitlab/group/app, other/app"
bb plugin config gitlab set defaultHost gitlab.example.dev
bb plugin reload gitlab
```

A background service refreshes the issue/MR cache every 5 minutes; the panel's
Refresh button (or `bb gitlab sync`) forces it. The cache holds open items plus
a page of recently closed and merged ones, so the Closed filter costs nothing.
Detail views, mutations, and mention resolution always go live through
`glab api`.

## Development

```sh
npm install --include=dev   # once
npm run typecheck
npm test
bb plugin build             # dist/server.js + dist/app.js + dist/app.css
bb plugin reload gitlab
```

`bb plugin dev` watches and reloads on every save. Plugin logs:
`bb plugin logs gitlab -f`.
